## Hi there

I'm a passionate **Home Assistant Tinkerer** and the creator of **HAGHS** (Home Assistant Global Health Score). My mission is to help the community move from "it just works" to "it's perfectly optimized."

<h3>My Main Project: HAGHS <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4132eb0e-0f37-4aa4-82ac-99ba9e3f46dc" width="30" align="texttop"></h3>

**HAGHS** is a benchmarking and health-monitoring tool for Home Assistant. It provides a real-time score based on system performance, database health, and configuration hygiene.

- **Latest Work:** Working on **v2.2** – introducing PSI (Pressure Stall Information) and proactive recorder auditing.
